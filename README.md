# Distributed Ledger Cube (DLC)

Distributed Ledger Cube is an interactive visualization of a Rubik's cube puzzle. Users can view and interact with a fully functioning model of a Rubik's cube. Next up on the project roadmap is to enable users to store value or data inside of a Rubik's puzzle and send it to their friends. 

Recipients can only unlock that data once they solved the puzzle!
