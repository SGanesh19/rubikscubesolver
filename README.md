# Distributed Ledger Cube (DLC)

Distributed Ledger Cube is an interactive visualization of a Rubik's cube puzzle and demonstration of the flexibility of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Users can create, view and interact with fully functioning 3D models of a Rubik's cube. They may also persist the state of a given Rubik's Cube on-chain to collaborate in solving with any number of counterparties on the network.
